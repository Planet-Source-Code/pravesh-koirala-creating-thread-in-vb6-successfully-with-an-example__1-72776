### Description

Creates and uses a thread (safely)
 
### More Info
 
Creating threads in VB6 using CreateThread. I know that simply using CreateThread doesn't works with VB and crashes VB but I have successfully created and used the thread to Monitor FileSystem Changes (using ReadDirectoryChangesW). This is a complicated piece of code and beginners can take up a lot of time understanding it (Specially if you don't know much about APIs and etcs). However, it must be used cautiously so I would ADVISE EVERYONE TO READ THE README AND OTHER DOCUMENTATIONS CAREFULLLY. After some more releases I think it will be completely safe to use this code. Take a look at it and send any comments to me via PSC. And do vote. Hope you will find this code useful.

Thanks
